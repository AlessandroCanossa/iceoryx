## Justifications for rule deactivation ##
#
# * rule: cert-err58-cpp
#   justification: Many warnings due to gtest 'TEST' macros like "initialization of
#       'test_info_'  with static storage duration may throw an exception that cannot be caught"
#
# * rule: cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions
#   justification: structs and classes in tests do not all follow the rule of five
#
# * rule: hicpp-special-member-functions
#   justification: same as for 'cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions'
#
# * rule: readability-identifier-naming
#   justification: structs and classes in tests do not obey the same naming convention like in production code
#
# * rule: cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory
#   justification: caused by TEST_F in gtest with internal macro generated construct: testing::internal::TestFactoryBase *
#
# * rule: cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
#   justification: caused by TEST_F in gtest with internal macro generated construct: test_info_

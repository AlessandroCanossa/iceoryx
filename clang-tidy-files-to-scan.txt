# IMPORTANT:
#    after the first # everything is considered a comment, add new files and
#    directories only at the top of this file
#
# we are able to use wildcards in this file, every warning free component
# should be added like:
#
# ./iceoryx_hoofs/include/iceoryx_hoofs/cxx/*
# ./iceoryx_hoofs/include/iceoryx_hoofs/internal/cxx/*
# ./iceoryx_hoofs/test/moduletests/test_cxx*
#
# When all warnings are fixed we can include folders and subfolder also with 
# wildcards like
#
# ./iceoryx_hoofs/include/**/*

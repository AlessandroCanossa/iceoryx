# IMPORTANT:
#    after the first # everything is considered a comment, add new files and
#    directories only at the top of this file
#
# Full scans can be very expensive therefore only single files should be
# listed in this file.
# Whenever a component is clang-tidy warning free one can move the whole
# component into .clang-tidy-diff-scans.txt but you have to perform a full
# local check of that component to ensure that it is warning free!
#
# 1. Make sure you use clang-tidy 15 or later! Otherwise we may miss some
#    warnings!
#    If clang 15 is not installed you can use the iceoryx environment for the
#    scan.
#
#       ./tools/scripts/ice_env.sh enter
#
# 2. Scan the folders you would like to move with:
#
#       ./tools/scripts/clang_tidy_check.sh full ./path/to/folder
#
#    Now get a tea and a cookie this will take some time
#        - I am talking about hours!
